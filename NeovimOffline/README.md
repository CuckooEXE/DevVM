# NeovimOffline — LazyVim for air-gapped Linux

A self-contained bundle that installs [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) + [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)
on a Debian/Ubuntu x86_64 machine with **zero network access**. Everything is
pre-downloaded on a connected "staging" machine, then copied to the offline
target where a single `./install.sh` does the rest.

**Languages supported out of the box:** C, C++, CMake, Python, Java, Zig, Rust,
Go, Lua, Shell, JSON, YAML, TOML, Markdown, Taskfile, Makefile,
JavaScript/TypeScript/HTML/CSS, Docker.

```

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Build the bundle (on a connected machine)

On this staging machine (Debian 13, online, has `git`, `curl`, `gcc`, `make`,
`python3`, `unzip`):

```bash
./stage.sh
```

This takes 10–30 minutes depending on bandwidth. It:

1. Downloads Neovim, Node.js, and JDK tarballs into the bundle.
2. Extracts them to a scratch `.stage/` dir and runs Neovim headlessly against
   the staged config, triggering `:Lazy sync`, `:MasonInstall`, and
   `:TSInstallSync` against every plugin/package/parser we need.
3. Copies the resulting `lazy/` and `mason/` trees into `share/nvim/`.

The Nerd Font used by LazyVim icons is installed by the parent
`DevVMSetup` pipeline (`post/05-fonts.sh`), not this bundle.

Re-runnable — each step (`./stage.sh fetch|plugins|mason|ts|copy`) is
idempotent. If a download fails, just re-run it.

### Step 2 — Move the bundle to the offline machine

```bash
# Any method works. Examples:
tar czf NeovimOffline.tar.gz NeovimOffline
# … copy NeovimOffline.tar.gz via USB / rsync / sneakernet …
tar xzf NeovimOffline.tar.gz
```

### Step 3 — Install on the offline machine

```bash
cd NeovimOffline
./install.sh --dry        # preview file operations
./install.sh              # real run
```

Installs into your `$HOME` (no root needed):

- `~/.local/share/nvim-runtime/` — Neovim runtime
- `~/.local/share/node/` — Node.js (for JS-based LSPs)
- `~/.local/share/jdk-21/` — OpenJDK 21 (for jdtls)
- `~/.config/nvim/` — LazyVim config
- `~/.local/share/nvim/{lazy,mason}` — plugins + LSPs
- Appends `PATH` + `JAVA_HOME` exports to `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc`

Open a new shell, run `nvim`. No network is touched.

`<leader>` = Space. Press it and wait — `which-key.nvim` shows a menu of all
available bindings. That's the fastest way to discover keymaps.

## Terminal font

Set your terminal emulator's font to **"JetBrainsMono Nerd Font"** (any
weight — Regular works) so LazyVim's icons render. Without a Nerd Font you'll
see boxes/question marks where icons should be. The font is installed
system-wide by `DevVMSetup/post/05-fonts.sh` (not by this bundle).

## Updating the bundle

Updates are intentionally a batch operation:

1. On the staging machine: `cd NeovimOffline && ./stage.sh`
   (delete `.stage/` first if you want a fully clean rebuild)
2. Copy the updated bundle to the offline machine.
3. `./install.sh --force` on the offline machine.

Do **not** run `:Lazy update` or `:MasonUpdate` on the offline machine — they
will fail (no internet) and may leave plugin state inconsistent. The config
already disables these checks; don't re-enable them.

## Adding a new language later

On the staging machine, edit `config/nvim/lua/plugins/extras.lua` and add the
`lazyvim.plugins.extras.lang.<name>` import. Then:

```bash
./stage.sh plugins    # pull in new plugin specs
./stage.sh mason      # install new LSP/formatter if the extra adds one
./stage.sh ts         # pull in the new treesitter parser
./stage.sh copy
```

Re-deploy on the offline machine.

## Troubleshooting

**"command not found: nvim"** — `source ~/.bashrc` (or open a new shell). The
installer appended `$HOME/.local/bin` to `PATH`.

**Icons show as `???` or squares** — the terminal isn't using a Nerd Font. Set
the font in your terminal's profile settings.

**`:Mason` shows a package as "not installed"** — the stage machine probably
failed to download it. Re-run `./stage.sh mason` on the stage machine and
re-sync the bundle.

**`:LspInfo` shows the server isn't attaching** — some LSPs need root markers
(e.g., `jdtls` needs a Gradle/Maven/`.project` file, `gopls` needs `go.mod`,
`rust-analyzer` needs `Cargo.toml`). Open a file inside a real project.

**Zig LSP (`zls`)** — Mason does NOT bundle `zls` reliably; the config at
`config/nvim/lua/plugins/lsp-fallbacks.lua` looks for `/opt/zls/zls` (matches
the user's prior Zig install layout) and falls back to `zls` on PATH. Install
`zls` system-wide from your Zig toolchain and it'll attach.
